				<h4>The machine learning revolution: ML innovation in 8 industries.</h4>
				<p>These days, there is a lot of confusion surrounding the term “artificial intelligence,” with people attributing it at different times to different technology domains. Machine learning and deep learning are on that list, too, though they’re distinct AI approaches. Both refer to techniques by which computer programs become “smarter” as they process more information...</p>

				<h4>Want transparency in government? Think blockchain in 2020.</h4>
				<p>In this era of divisive national politics, it’s worth remembering that we all have a shared interest in improved government transparency, efficiency, and security. So it’s perhaps not surprising that blockchain, the distributed digital ledger technology, is being cited as a powerful tool for improving the operations of government...</p>

				<h4>5 Reasons why the world needs ethical AI.</h4>
				<p>In the U.S., 98% of medical students take a pledge commonly referred to as the Hippocratic oath. The specific pledges vary by medical school and bear little resemblance to the 2,500-year-old oath attributed to the Greek physician Hippocrates. Modern pledges recognize the unique role doctors play in their patients’ lives and delineate a code of ethics to guide physicians’ actions...</p>

				<h4>The future of blockchain? Revealing lessons from the Dow Jones 30.</h4>
				<p>News about blockchain itself can go unnoticed given the public interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. After all, stories about buying pizzas with Bitcoin are flashier than an analysis of how blockchain might improve the security and portability of medical records. </p>

				<h4>Artificial wombs and designer babies: Is this humanity's future?.</h4>
				<p>In spring 2017, the world got its first glimpse of extracorporeal incubation for fetuses – also known as growing a mammal outside of its mother’s body. Scientists successfully grew eight lambs in large, protective sacks that were hooked up to machines providing amniotic fluid and oxygen...</p>

				<h4>Helpful AI terms for today’s business professional.</h4>

				<h4>A snapshot of AI disruption in 27 industries.</h4>
				<p>A report from McKinsey estimated that as much as $12 billion was invested globally in artificial intelligence technologies during 2016, including projects focused on machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous vehicles. That figure cuts across industries, and in real-world terms represents thousands of individual R&D projects. </p>

				<h4>Neural dust and neural lace may be the future of computer interfaces.</h4>
				<p>If scientists and entrepreneurs have their way, the future of computer interfaces is devices that connect us to computers using just our thoughts. It sounds like science fiction but when you’re talking about rewriting the rules of human communication, it’s worth considering just how feasible the technology might be.</p>
